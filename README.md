# Please, Die
This is my entry for the [Js13kGames compo](http://js13kgames.com/), a JavaScript coding competition
for HTML5 Game Developers where the file size limit is set to a maximum of 13
kilobytes. The actual size of the game is **11848 bytes**. This year the theme is **Reversed**.

In typical platformers you have to avoid enemies, avoid pits, collect stuffs, stay alive as long as possible
and be happy. _Please, Die_ is not the typical platformer. Things are kind of reversed here, so you have
to help our little character with a very simple task: to die.
